Welcome to **Canaveral**, an iOS app providing comprehensive SpaceX launch details to both space enthusiasts and those with a casual interest. I decided to open source the project in the event others in the community wanted to contribute, learn, and build a SwiftUI app.

## Roadmap

| Status | Goals | Notes |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| ❌ | Show Upcoming & Previous Launch Details | This would be bare minimum required to submit to App Store |
| ❌ | Show list of Rockets & Details | This would build upon the first release and add more detail around the operation. |
| ❌ | Local Launch Notifications | Sign up for push notifications on a per launch, or all launches basis |
| ❌ | About SpaceX Company Details  | Beyond the data, pulling together some basic information about the company and it's history would add depth to the app |
| ❌ | Where is Starman? | Show where Starman (Elon's Red Roadster w/ passenger launched as a demo paylod in the first Falcon Heavy launch) is, and fun facts about distance traveled, duration of mission, etc. |
| ❌ | MacOS Target | Writing in SwiftUI, this could be actually somewhat straightforward, but given the current state of ~~Marzipan~~ Catalyst, it may also prove to be quite the challenge |
| ❌ | WatchOS Target | Some sort of complication for the watchface would be fun |
| ❌ | tvOS Target | Probably a multimedia heavy experience, being able to view pictures from recent launches, and details about upcoming |

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome. If you'd like to participate, [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/sabensm/Canaveral/pull/new). If you're looking to implement a brand new feature, please consider the above roadmap.

This project is in its infancy and because of that GitHub Issues are disabled. This is to help promote interested individuals becoming actively involved in the development of this app.

Much of the data as it relates to launches, missions, rockets, etc. will be sourced from [SpaceX-API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). You may want to take some time to familiarize yourself with the API prior to contributing.
